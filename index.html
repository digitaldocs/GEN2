Potential challenges include managing the significant MeRFB lead time to prevent overall schedule delays, ensuring robust community and stakeholder buy-in amidst diverse expectations, and refining the preliminary risk register. Broader implications involve securing the project's social license through early engagement, setting the definitive pace for future phases based on procurement timelines, and providing the robust organizational and strategic bedrock necessary for successful, controlled project execution.",
